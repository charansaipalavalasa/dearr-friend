                        <strong>Dear Friend.</strong>
                        <p>
                            “A single rose can be my garden…a single friend can be my happiness.” and its u obviously in my life u had always been a great and a caring person 
                            there are some situtaions where we could fight and do not speak up for weeks but does't mean at all because i always thrives for ur time .
                            its gonna be hard but i wish u to always keep the smile on ur face and never forget abt me because i will always be there waiting for u and u don't
                            even hesitate to speak and one last thing never ever be sad in any of the situations and always try to share them up and try to deviate.
                            Always be happy and keep smilimg my friend
                        </p>
